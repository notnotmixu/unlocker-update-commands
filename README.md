# Mixer
Here are update commands needed for building a startpos mod that is compatible with my unlocker (aka Mixer). Please only use them for making submods to Mixer, at least not without my permission. You'll probably wanna keep my unlocker as a required mod, so you don't have to worry about script stuff that is needed for this mod to function properly. Just name your mod higher than my mod's file name, that way you'll overwrite my startpos files.

Files included:

update_commands_slot_templates == update commands for custom slot templates

update_commands_unlocker == update commands for unlocking factions and several other things

!!startpos_helper.pack == this is a movie mod that must be inside your Total War WARHAMMER II/data folder when you're building the startpos. Keep in mind that it is a movie mod, so you'll wanna remove it from data after you're done building your startpos.

You don't wanna run the entire update_commands_unlocker file at once with Tweak/Dave, keep it short, something like 400-500 lines should be ok. Dave will break something if you run the entire thing at once, been there done that.

Oh and Dave expects a .txt file called update_commands and not update_commands_blahblah, so either create a file like that or rename these.
